# Autoware-Auto-465-Final-Wittcop
Xavier Wittcop:  I was a researcher and paper writer for project. Researched and provided info on manipulating cloud point data and vlp-16 data. Found a Matlab solution that allows the team to generate cloud point data. I also researched and provided proposed defense measures for our attack in the report. Also help write conclusion for project paper.

P.S. The files I helped work on are located in the "master" branch
