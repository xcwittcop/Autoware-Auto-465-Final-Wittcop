# Autoware-Auto-465-Final-Wittcop
Xavier Wittcop: Wrote proposed defense techniques and measures in report and assisted the main programmer create certain files, specifically the manv2.py and manv3.py files, by researching and provided information on manipulating cloud point and vlp-16 data. I also provided a Matlab solution that allows us to generate cloud point data, but that was not used in our attack as the goal of the attack is to manipulate data, not inject harmful data. Project files are located in "master" branch.
