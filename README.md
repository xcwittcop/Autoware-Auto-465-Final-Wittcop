# Autoware-Auto-465-Final-Wittcop
Xavier Wittcop:  My contributions to the team included being the researcher and project paper writer. To help improve the teamâ€™s attack python scripts, I provided research on cloud point and VLP-16 data. This gave us a further understanding about the two types of data, but it also led to the conclusion that with the time given for the project, the team would could not write a solution to convert cloud point data to vlp-16 data. I also provided a Matlab solution that can generate cloud point data for us, but that was not used for the project as our attack was based on manipulating and corrupting data, not injecting harmful data. I also researched and provided proposed defense measures for our attack in the report. Lastly, I helped write the conclusion section of the project paper.

P.S. The files I helped work on are located in the "master" branch
